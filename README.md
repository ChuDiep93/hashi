Hashi is an EVM Header Relay Aggregator, designed to facilitate a
[principled approach to cross-chain bridge security](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-principled-approach-to-bridges/14725?u=auryn).
The primary insight being that the vast majority of bridge-related security incidents could have had minimal impact if
the systems relying on them had built in some redundancy. In other words, it's much more secure to require messages be
validated by multiple independent mechanisms, rather than by just one.

## Features

Hashi allows users to:

- Build custom oracle adapter contracts for any header relay mechanism they would like to use.
- Query a header relay for the block header for a given block on a given chain.
- Query a set of header relays the block headers for a given block on a given chain.
- Query for a unanimously agreed upon block header from a set of header relays for a given block on a given chain.
- Query for a block header agreed upon by a threshold of header relays for a given block on a given chain; M/N oracles
  must report the same header for it to be considered valid.

Hashi's additional redundancy obviously comes with a higher gas cost, along with moving only as quickly as the slowest
oracle in a given set. However, this trade-off seems well worth it given the scope and frequency of past bridge-related
security incidents.
